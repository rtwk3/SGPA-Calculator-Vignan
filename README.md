# SGPA Calculator - Vignan University

This is a simple web-based SGPA (Semester Grade Point Average) calculator designed for Vignan University students. It allows users to input their course details (credits and grade points) and calculates their SGPA based on the standard academic formula.

## 📐 SGPA Calculation

The SGPA is calculated using the formula:

$$
SGPA = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} (C_i \times P_i)}{\sum_{i=1}^{n} C_i}
$$

Where:
- \( C_i \) = Credits for the \( i^{th} \) course  
- \( P_i \) = Grade points for the \( i^{th} \) course

The calculator also supports light and dark themes for better usability.
